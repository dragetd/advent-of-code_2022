# Advent of Code 2022

This repository is hosted at `https://gitlab.com/draget-advent-of-code/aoc2022` and only mirrored to GitHub.

Draget's (Michael G) solutions to Advent of Code 2022. The goal is not only to solve the tasks, but add a little something each time to grow my skills in different areas.

All new aspects are documented in the [changes](#changelog) section below.

## Technology

This project is based on [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) and features a [Desktop Compose](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/compose-mpp/) based GUI that will also improve over time and get more features. Currently, it allows you to paste the input, select the day and sub-task (e.g. `1a` or `3b`) and calculate the solution.


## Building and running

* Build: `./gradlew build`
* Test: `./gradlew verify`
* Run: `./gradlew run`

## Contributing

Even if I want to learn myself, I still very much appreciate if you want to make suggestions or tell me how I can do something better, by raising an issue or suggesting a change in a MR. While I doubt anyone would do that for a AoC repository, input is still welcome!
